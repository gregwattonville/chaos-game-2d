## Background

This project was inspired by the youtube video: [Playing the Chaos Game (Sierpinski Triangle)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=droTYSmSGHg).

I wanted the opportunity for students and myself to explore the concept of Chaos Game and view it from different perspectives to learn and build understanding.
